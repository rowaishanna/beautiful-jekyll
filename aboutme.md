subtitle: I'm an aspiring Data Scientist and I ![Image][2] data
---

My name is Rowais Hanna. I love drawing meaningful insights from available data.  My current data interests:

- **American Football: NFL Analytics**

Especially after my favorite team's (NYG) General Manager referred to his newly established analytics team as "Computer Folks" 

- **Robotic Decision Making**

The robots are [here][1].  And they won't teach themselves.



## my background
---
I'm a scientist by education (Biology, Chemistry), worked in engineering roles and turned into Pharmaceutical Project Manager. My educational background lends itself to data science, as working with data, the scientific method, and mathematical and statistical approaches have been tools of my trade since college.

## my hobbies
---
I am blessed with 2 young children and the most supporting wife and best friend.  When I'm not spending time with them, I enjoy photography and drone videography.  You can check out some of my work [here][3].
